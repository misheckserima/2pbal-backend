 1. **Value-first messaging**: Emphasize outcomes and savings before mentioning price.
 2. **Anchoring**: Show the "original" price crossed out next to the discounted price to create perception of value.
 3. **Scarcity and Urgency**: Highlight limited-time offers or limited availability without being pushy.
 4. **Social Proof**: Use testimonials and case studies to validate the value.
 5. **Visual Hierarchy**: Design the page so that the user sees benefits first, then the packages, and finally the pricing (if they scroll).
 We'll restructure the wireframe to:
 Homepage:
   - Hero: Focus on the transformation and savings.
   - Problem/Solution: Reinforce the pain points and how 2Pbal saves money and time.
   - Service Packages: Show packages with emphasis on value, then show discounted prices.
   - How It Works: Build trust in the process.
   - Testimonials: Social proof of savings and results.
   - Final CTA: Value-driven call to action.
 Service Packages Page:
   - Comparison table with value-focused descriptions and then show the discounted price with original price crossed out.
   - Detailed package breakdowns that focus on ROI and savings.
 All Services Page:
   - Focus on the value of each service and how it contributes to savings.
 Custom Quote Page:
   - Focus on the value of a custom solution and the savings it can bring.
 Let's go step by step.
